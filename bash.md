# Bash

## Add an alias

```sh
# open your bash_profile with nano
nano ~/.bash_profile
# add your alias
alias f='fish'
# ctrl+x then y to save
```

## Sort alphabetically ðŸ‘Œ

You may find that commands like `ll` are under your `~/.bashrc` file,
if not then add the following as an alias:

```sh
ls -lart | sort -k9,9
```

## See file permissions

If you need to set the permission on a file (with `chmod`) but don't
know what the permissions of similar files are like you can use
`stat`, the following command displays the permissions of the contents
of the `.ssh/` folder:

```sh
stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh/*
```
