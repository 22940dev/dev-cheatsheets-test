# Useful Yarn commands

This is just stuff that I have put down that I find I use a lot of the
time for my own reference.

## Update dependencies

```
yarn upgrade
```

## displays the location of the yarn bin folder.

```
yarn bin
```

## list installed packages.

```
yarn ls
```

## create-react-app

Couple of good one here from
[@beedesignllc](https://twitter.com/beedesignllc) 👌

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app-name
```

☝️ downloads and runs latest `create-react-app` works for other
similarly named pkgs

## flow

```sh
yarn flow
```

☝️ will run `node_modules/.bin/flow` without you having to add it as
a package.json script.
