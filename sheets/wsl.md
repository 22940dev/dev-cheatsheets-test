# Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)

There's a few config options as part of the WSL I always forget

## Linuxbrew

Linuxbrew is like Chocolatey for Windows or Homebrew for OSx

```sh
brew install package
```

## What version of Ubuntu is installed

```sh
lsb_release -a
```

## lxrun.exe

Use `lxrun.exe` to interact with the WSL from the CMD prompt

Burn it all ðŸ”¥:

```sh
lxrun /uninstall /full
```
